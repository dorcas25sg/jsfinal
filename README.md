# jsfinal
Final Project for CPLN-692 / MUSA-611 JavaScript Programming for Planners and Designers

# Note: You need to run D3 (Javascript) locally from your computer!

Because I am loading external files (you can download them in the 'datasets' folder) and Javascript cannot load files directly from your hard drive, you will need to run it locally either through a Javascript IDE or...

**Set up a Local Server**:
- Download and install Python if you don't have it
- From the command line (search for 'cmd'), navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files from this page
- enter "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" for Python 2.7 or "python -m http.server 8000" for Python 3.6
- Type this into your browser: http://localhost:8000 or http://localhost:8000/index.html - you shoul be able to see it work!
